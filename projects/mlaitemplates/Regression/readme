These are simple templates for machine learning algorithms. They currently work for one independent variables.  

To change into multivariable models, edit the line 

	X = dataset.iloc[:, 1:2].values 

 Change the 2 to the index of your last independent variable column. If the last is the target/dependent variable, use  â€“1.
